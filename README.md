mousejiggler UNCAPPED
============

Mouse Jiggler is a very simple piece of software whose sole function is to "fake" mouse input to Windows, and jiggle the mouse pointer back and forth.

Useful for avoiding screensavers or other things triggered by idle detection that, for whatever reason, you can't turn off any other way; or as a quick way to stop a screensaver activating during an installation or when monitoring a long operation without actually having to muck about with the screensaver settings.

Also I found out, this helps with certain programs not detecting mouse cursor movement when using things such as pyauto programs.

But now you can set the timer to just about anything, obviously you cant go below 0.001 because it could cause instabilities, and I don't know the max cap, but I'm sure there is some limitation to the max cap that can't be removed without reworking it.

Installation
============
**NOT AVAILABLE ON THE UNCAPPED VERSION**

Portable Version
----------------

This is the only available version because I have no clue how to make the Installation version work with the modified build

I removed the rest of the text because for some reason its mostly no longer true with this version as originally it said something about it being ~83MB but the folder was able to turn into only ~430KB

Operation
=========

Simply run the MouseJiggle.exe included in the release .zip file. Check the "Jiggling?" checkbox to start jiggling the mouse pointer; uncheck it to stop. The jiggle is slight enough that you should be able to use the computer normally even with jiggling enabled.

Check the "Settings..." checkbox to reveal the settings; these should be relatively self-explanatory. The 'Zen jiggle?' checkbox enables a mode in which the pointer is jiggled 'virtually' - the system believes it to be moving and thus screen saver activation, etc., is prevented, but the pointer does not actually move. This, however, may not work with a few applications which chose to implement their own idle detection.

To minimize Mouse Jiggler to the notification area, click the down-arrow button.
